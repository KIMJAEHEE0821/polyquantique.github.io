**Interested in joining?**  
A significant part of scientific research can be understood as collective problem solving. Not having a group that can look at problems from diverse vantage points is a wasted opportunity. We commit to build a diverse research group from its conception and to make sure to be attentive to and supportive of the needs and ambitions of students and postdocs, especially those who belong to marginalized or underrepresented groups in science and engineering.

Reach us by email with the subject: "[Name], Undergrad/Master/PhD/Postdoc Applicant" 

1. A motivation letter describing your research interests, background and experience

2. Attach a CV.

3. Course transcripts, when available. These can be submitted in French, English, Spanish or Portuguese.

For research areas in the group please have a look at the [research](../research) section.
