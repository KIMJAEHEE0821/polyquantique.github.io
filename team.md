## Interested in joining?


Reach us by email with the subject: "[Name], Undergrad/Master/PhD/Postdoc Applicant" 

1. A short note stating your research interests and experience.

2. Attach a CV.

3. A full coverletter describing how your research interests and background align and expand on the abilities of our group.

For research areas in the group please have a look at the [research](../research) section.


A significant part of scientific research can be understood as collective problem solving. Not having a group that can look at problems from diverse vantage points is a wasted opportunity. In order to avoid this pitfall, we commit to build a diverse research group from its conception and to make sure to be attentive to and supportive of the needs and ambitions of students and postdocs, especially those who belong to marginalized or underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
