title: Quantum Photonics and Information at Polytechnique Montr√©al
---

Welcome to our website!

At Polyquantique, we develop the theory and computational tools underpinning the next generation of nonclassical bright light sources and devices needed for building fault-tolerant quantum computers and quantum communication networks. We work at the intersection of quantum optics, photonics and information. Find out more about our current research in the links below.
