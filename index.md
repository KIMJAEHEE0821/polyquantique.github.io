title: Quantum Photonics and Information at Polytechnique Montr√©al
---

Welcome to our website!

At Polyquantique, we develop the theory and computational tools underpinning the next generation of nonclassical bright light sources and devices needed for building fault-tolerant quantum computers and quantum communication networks. We work at the intersection of quantum optics, photonics and information. Find out more about our current research in the links below. 

We are actively looking for undergraduate interns, graduate students and postdocs interested in the following areas

* Quantum computing using photon based architectures
* Applications of Machine Learning in designing photonic experiments
* (Gaussian) Boson Sampling
* Quantum metrology and spectroscopy
* Generation of squeezed states useful for heralding applications
* Heralded generation of non-Gaussian light
* Polaritons and topological photonics
* Quantum benchmarking and tomography of complex quantum states

See openings for more information on how to apply.
