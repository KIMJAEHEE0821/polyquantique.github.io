title: Quantum Photonics and Information at Polytechnique Montréal  
---
Bienvenue sur notre site web!

At Polyquantique we work at the intersection of quantum photonics and information. We develop the theory and computational tools underpinning the next generation of nonclassical bright light sources and devices needed for building fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum communication networks and quantum sensors. These new technologies will allow us to solve practical computational problems in chemistry and material science with unprecedented speed, build impregnable information networks and provide us with the most precise and gentle probes to study delicate materials and biological samples.

We collaborate with academic colleagues at Polytechnique Montréal and beyond, across Canada and also abroad, as well as with government and industrial partners.

You can find more about what we do in the [research](research) section.

**We are actively looking for undergraduate interns, graduate students and postdocs.** Have a look at our [research](research) and if contributing to the development of new quantum technologies interests you, get in touch following the instructions in the [team](team) section. 

[Polytechnique](https://www.polymtl.ca/en) offers exceptional opportunities for learning and research while living in beautiful and welcoming Montréal, a safe but never boring city that consistently ranks as the [best city in North America to be a student](https://www.montrealinternational.com/en/study/).
