title: Quantum Photonics and Information at Polytechnique Montréal
---

Welcome to our website!

We develop the theory and computational tools underpinning the next generation of nonclassical bright light sources and devices needed for building fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum communication networks and quantum sensors. We work at the intersection of quantum optics, photonics and information. Find out more about our current research in the links below. 

**We are actively looking for undergraduate interns, graduate students and postdocs.**
Have a look at our [research](research) and if you are interested, apply following the instructions in the [team](team) section. [Polytechnique](https://www.polymtl.ca/en) offers exceptional opportunities for learning and research while living in beautiful and welcoming Montréal, a safe but never boring city that consistently ranks as the [best city in North America to be a student](https://www.montrealinternational.com/en/study/).
