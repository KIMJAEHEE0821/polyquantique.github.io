## About the group

The Polyquantique research group led by Nicolás Quesada specializes in quantum photonics and quantum information. The group is looking for a highly motivated candidate at the *postdoctoral level* with expertise in quantum and nonlinear optics/quantum sensing/quantum metrology.

We are a theory group with a significant computational component that collaborates closely with experimental groups and partners in government and industry. We write [open source code](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/open-science-basics/open-research-software-and-open-source) and do [reproducible science](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/2018/09/19/reproducible-computational-science/) (that is, making all data and code available to others to easily execute).  

We believe that a significant part of scientific research can be understood as collective problem solving. Not having a group that can look at problems from diverse vantage points is a wasted opportunity. We are thus committed to building a diverse research group from its conception and to being attentive to and supportive of the needs and ambitions of students and postdocs, especially those who belong to marginalized or underrepresented groups in science and engineering. 

We are based in beautiful and welcoming Montréal, a safe but never boring city that consistently ranks as the best city in North America to be a student.

## About the position

We are starting a research program into ultrafast quantum sensing and metrology. We are in particular looking for candidates with a background in quantum and nonlinear optics/quantum sensing/quantum metrology.
The project aims to develop ultrafast probe states for doing sensing in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the visible/near-visible band.
Besides theory, the candidate will develop software for optimization of ultrafast parametric sources with colleagues in Montréal and will interact with experimentalists both locally and abroad.


## Interested in joining?

We hope the selected candidate will join the group towards the end of 2022/early 2023. To submit your application reach us by email with the subject: "[Name], Postdoc Applicant" including the following information:

1. A motivation letter (2 pages max.) describing your research interests, background and experience. 

2. A curriculum vitae.

3. The *names* of two researchers familiar with the applicants work, willing to provide a letter of reference.
