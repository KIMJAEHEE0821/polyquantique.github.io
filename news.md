* [22-04-12](https://twitter.com/QuantumAephraim/status/1646156193964883969) Nicol√°s talked about photonic quantum computational advantage at the CIFAR Quantum Information Science meeting in Boston.

* 22-02-23 Nicol√°s presented some of the work done by the group in the [Photonique Quantique Qu√©bec](https://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour-actualite/nouvelles/photonique-quantique-une-premiere-rencontre-fructueuse-polytechnique-montreal-pour-la-communaute-de) symposium.
It was a great opportunity to show the recent work done by [Yuan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06069), [Martin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13491), [Javier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10058) and [Salvador](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01714). We also got to learn about the work from the other MEIE chairs in the √Æle de Montr√©al, [Philippe St-Jean](https://psjlab.ca/) and [Kai Wang](https://wkai.org/).

* 23-02-23 [Yuan defended her PhD thesis](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1628816114640723968) on "Automated design of photonic quantum circuits" at T√©l√©com Paris üéâ. Many many congrats Dr. Yao üë©‚Äçüéì.   

* 21-02-23 [Nicol√°s presented a talk](https://twitter.com/QuantumAephraim/status/1628076281056178200) at the [2023 Physics Siposium](https://siposium2023.physics.utoronto.ca/program/) celebrating 50 years of John Sipe at the University of Toronto.

* [20-02-23](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1627722740118454295) We welcomed [Guillaume Thekkadath](https://twitter.com/GThekkadath) from NRC. Lots of interesting discussions and avenues for future collaboration besides his fantastic talk on measuring modes of light.

* 03-02-23 Nicol√°s will be giving the physics [colloquium at McGill](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/seminars/PSC_quesada.html).

* 01-02-23 Our work in collaboration with Changhun Oh and Liang Jiang from Chicago on [Quantum-inspired classical algorithm for graph problems by Gaussian boson sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00536) appears on the arXiv.

* 18-01-23 Jiaqi and Yanic presented their work on optimal pumps for SPDC and photon-number cumulants of Gaussian states, respectively, at [INTRIQ's CONFETI](https://sites.google.com/view/confeti2023/francais)

* [16-01-23](https://qubit-social.xyz/@polyquantique/109735933205995275) [Prof. Hubert de Guise](https://hdeguise.lakeheadu.ca/) will be spending part of his sabbatical with us and will give a mini course on [Group Theory and Applications](https://polyquantique.github.io/groupes/).

* [01-01-23](https://qubit-social.xyz/web/@polyquantique/109683981877480151) What a way to start the year: we welcome two new PhD students!
Great to have you on board **Gisell** and **Ari**!
