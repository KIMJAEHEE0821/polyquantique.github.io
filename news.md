* [06-01-22](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1478891012244267008) Our collaboration with colleagues in Maryland, Toronto, Berlin, Chicago and Ulm on [Quantum computational advantage via high-dimensional Gaussian boson sampling](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi7894) appeared today in Science Advances!

* [05-01-22](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1479587281912614912) Martin Houde joins as the first postdoc in the group. Welcome to Polyquantique Martin! 

* 15-12-21 Nicolas gave a talk on [Quantum Computational Advantage via High-Dimensional Gaussian Boson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12474) for Chile's [Millennium Institute for Research in Optics, MIRO](https://www.iniciativamilenio.cl/en/miro-2/).

* [08-12-21](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1468772841722109953) [Mr Mustard](https://github.com/xanaduAI/Mrmustard), a library that we helped develop in collaboration with [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai), is out. See this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/polyquantique/mrmustard_examples/blob/main/making_cats.ipynb) where we use it to find a heralding circuit for making a mesoscopic cat state.

* [22-10-21](https://twitter.com/PRX_Quantum/status/1451591689525731333) Our work with Xanadu on [Fast Simulation of Bosonic Qubits via Gaussian Functions in Phase Space is published in PRX Quantum](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040315).

* [13-10-21](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1448811012011044867) Our work in collaboration with Daniel Grier, Daniel Brod, Marcos Alonso and Juan Miguel Arrazola on [The Classical Complexity of Bipartite Gaussian Boson Sampling appears on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06964).

* [08-10-21](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1447769998403977217) Our work in collaboration with the evangelists, Luke, Matteo, Marco and John, on life [Beyond photon pairs appears on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04340).

* [04-10-21](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1445054960471785472) Nous sommes a Montr√©al.
