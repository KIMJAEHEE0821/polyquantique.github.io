* 03-02-23 Nicolas will giving the physics [colloqium at McGill](Quantum-inspired classical algorithm for graph problems by Gaussian boson sampling).

* 01-02-23 Our work in collaboration with Changhun Oh and Liang Jiang from Chicago on [Quantum-inspired classical algorithm for graph problems by Gaussian boson sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00536) appears on the arXiv.

* 18-01-23 Jiaqi and Yanic presented their work on optimal pumps for SPDC and photon-number cumulants of Gaussian states, respectively, at [INTRIQ's CONFETI](https://sites.google.com/view/confeti2023/francais)

* [16-01-23](https://qubit-social.xyz/@polyquantique/109735933205995275) [Prof. Hubert de Guise](https://hdeguise.lakeheadu.ca/) will be spending part of his sabbatical with us and will give a mini course on [Group Theory and Applications](https://polyquantique.github.io/groupes/).

* [01-01-23](https://qubit-social.xyz/web/@polyquantique/109683981877480151) What a way to start the year: we welcome two new PhD students!
Great to have you on board **Gisell** and **Ari**!
