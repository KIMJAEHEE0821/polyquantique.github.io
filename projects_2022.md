The Polyquantique research group led by Nicol√°s Quesada specializes in quantum photonics and quantum information. The group is looking for highly motivated candidates at all levels (undergraduate interns, graduate students, postdocs) with expertise in quantum optics, quantum information, quantum metrology, quantum error correction, topological photonics or machine learning. We are theory group with a significant computational component. We write open source code and do reproducible science and engineering.

For graduate student positions, applications should be sent by February 15 / 2022 to start in the Fall of the same year.
For postdocs applications, they will be reviewed until filled.

Examples of possible projects include:

### Inverse design for pulsed squeezed light

Squeezed light is perhaps the easiest type of non-classical light that can be generated in a deterministic way.
For many applications, especially when doing heralding experiments for the generation of bosonic states useful for error-correction, the squeezed light needs to be generated in a single consistent temporal mode. This implies that whenever photons are counted in a heralding setup it is known with certainty which temporal mode was measured and no which-path information damages interference. The aim of this project is to develop inverse-design methods for the optimization of squeezed light sources in resonators and waveguides. 

### Optimal Heralding Protocols

While single-temporal mode squeezed light is the basic ingredient for making non-Gaussian light using heralding

### Deterministic non-Gaussian light

### Boson Sampling benchmarking
