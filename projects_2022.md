The Polyquantique research group led by Nicol√°s Quesada specializes in quantum photonics and quantum information. The group is looking for highly motivated candidates at all levels (undergraduate interns, graduate students, postdocs) with expertise in quantum optics, quantum information, quantum metrology, quantum error correction, topological photonics or machine learning. We are theory group with a significant computational component.  

We write open source code and do reproducible science and engineering.  

For graduate student positions, applications should be sent by February 15 / 2022 to start in the Fall of the same year.  

For postdocs applications, they will be reviewed until filled.  

Examples of possible projects include:  

**1. Inverse design for pulsed squeezed light**  

Squeezed light is perhaps the easiest type of non-classical light that can be generated in a deterministic way.
For many applications, especially when doing heralding experiments for the generation of bosonic states useful for error-correction, the squeezed light needs to be generated in a single consistent temporal mode. This implies that whenever photons are counted in a heralding setup it is known with certainty which temporal mode was measured and no which-path information damages interference. The aim of this project is to develop inverse-design methods for the optimization of squeezed light sources in resonators and waveguides. 

**2. Optimal Heralding Protocols**  

With optimal sources of squeezed light at hand, the next step for the generation of bosonic code states or any other non-Gaussian state, is to find optiwal ways of interfering and measuring these states. The aim of this project is to develop methods for finding optimal interferometric schemes for non-Gaussian state generation, including realistic imperfections such as mode mismatch, loss, dark counts and photon number miscathegorization. These schemes will ultimately lead to understanding the possibilitites and limitations of non-linear optical heralded sources for error-correction and their use in the context of quantum computation and communication.

**3. Deterministic non-Gaussian light**  

A different approach to generate non-Gaussian light useful for error correction is to strongly drive material non-linearities to the point where any linear approximation to study the dynamics of the quantized electromagnetic field breaks down.
Multiple experimental teams are approaching this limit by carefully engineering nonlinear structures in a manifold of materials.
At this stage the theoretical treatment of the quantum states generated in this structures requires new tools beyond the ones used to deal with squeezed light. The aim of this project is to develop these new tools, which will likely involve a mix of Gaussian continous-variable techniques, tensor network methods and statistical approximations such as cumulants expansions. 


**4. Boson Sampling benchmarking**

One of the most appealing proposals to demonstrate quantum advantage, when a quantum processor performs calculations beyond the reach of any classical supercomputer, is Gaussian Boson Sampling. This quantum photonic architecture consists of squeezed light which is sent into an interferometer and is then measured using photon counters. 
Unlike for random circuit sampling, another leading approach to demostrate quantum advantage, very little is known about how to certify the quantum advantage of a Gaussian Boson Sampler, and this is precisely the main goal of project. We aim to answer the question: how can one certify that a Gaussian Boson Sampler is indeed performing a task beyond the capabilities of any classical supercomputer.

***Interested in joining?***  
A significant part of scientific research can be understood as collective problem solving. Not having a group that can look at problems from diverse vantage points is a wasted opportunity. We commit to build a diverse research group from its conception and to make sure to be attentive to and supportive of the needs and ambitions of students and postdocs, especially those who belong to marginalized or underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
