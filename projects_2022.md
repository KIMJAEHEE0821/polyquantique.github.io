The Polyquantique research group led by Nicol√°s Quesada specializes in quantum photonics and quantum information. The group is looking for highly motivated candidates at all levels (undergraduate interns, graduate students, postdocs) with expertise or interest in quantum photonics, quantum information, quantum optics, quantum metrology, quantum error correction, topological photonics or machine learning. 

We are a theory group with a significant computational component. We write [open source code](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/open-science-basics/open-research-software-and-open-source) and do [reproducible science](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/2018/09/19/reproducible-computational-science/).  

We believe that a significant part of scientific research can be understood as collective problem solving. Not having a group that can look at problems from diverse vantage points is a wasted opportunity. We commit to build a diverse research group from its conception and to make sure to be attentive to and supportive of the needs and ambitions of students and postdocs, especially those who belong to marginalized or underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  

Examples of possible projects include:  

**1. Inverse design for pulsed squeezed light**  

Squeezed light is perhaps the easiest type of non-classical light that can be generated in a deterministic way.
For many applications, especially when doing heralding experiments for the generation of bosonic states useful for error-correction, the squeezed light needs to be generated in a single consistent temporal mode. This implies that whenever photons are counted in a heralding setup no which-path information can damage interference. The aim of this project is to develop inverse-design methods for the optimization of squeezed light sources in resonators and waveguides in a single consistent temporal mode.

**2. Optimal Heralding Protocols**  

With optimal sources of squeezed light at hand, the next step for the generation of bosonic code states, or any other non-Gaussian state, is to find optimal ways of interfering and measuring these states. The aim of this project is to develop methods for finding optimal interferometric schemes for non-Gaussian state generation, including realistic imperfections such as mode mismatch, loss, dark counts and photon number miscategorization. The methods used to tackle this problem will borrow many ideas from machine learning. For example the interferometers will play the role of the linear part of a neural network, while the measurement acts like the nonlinear 'activation function'. These schemes will ultimately lead to understanding the possibilities and limitations of nonlinear optical heralded sources for error-correction and their use in the context of quantum computation and communication.

**3. Deterministic non-Gaussian light**  

A different approach to generate non-Gaussian light useful for error correction is to strongly drive material nonlinearities to the point where any linear approximation to study the dynamics of the quantized electromagnetic field breaks down.
Multiple experimental teams are approaching this limit by carefully engineering nonlinear structures in a manifold of materials.
At this stage, the theoretical treatment of the quantum states generated in these structures requires new tools beyond the ones used to deal with squeezed light. The aim of this project is to develop these new tools, which will likely involve a mix of Gaussian continuous-variable techniques, tensor network methods and statistical approximations such as cumulants expansions.


**4. Boson Sampling benchmarking**

One of the most appealing proposals to demonstrate quantum advantage, when a quantum processor performs calculations beyond the reach of any classical supercomputer, is Gaussian Boson Sampling. This quantum photonic architecture consists of squeezed light which is sent into an interferometer and is then measured using photon counters.
Unlike for random circuit sampling, another leading approach to demonstrate quantum advantage, very little is known about how to certify the quantum advantage of a Gaussian Boson Sampler, and this is precisely the main goal of the project. We aim to answer the question: how can one certify that a Gaussian Boson Sampler is indeed performing a task beyond the capabilities of any classical supercomputer?
